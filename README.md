# Lemme-speak-it-for-you

Hey guys , this is a very simple project I made. So basically I was playing with apis and thought of using this text-to-speech api which is not the synthesis
one but another one. You just paste the text in the text area and press submit and you will hear the text into speech but it is a bit laggy when it comes to punctuations which I 
will fix in the near future

PEACE OUT!✌✌
